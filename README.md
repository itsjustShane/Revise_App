# Operation Relay
Healthcare Project App for BeachHacks 2025 and beyond

# Problem
Procedures are complicated for patients and their families to understand, especially when they have to make multiple decisions along the way and they don’t have the information to make them. This is especially a problem in the case of medical errors, which have seen a rise in recent years, and every second counts in making the right decision. Patients and their families need proper information and guidance as quickly as possible.

# Idea
Operation Relay tracks surgery procedure in real time for patient and patient’s family, as well as providing the workflow. Time stamps for important steps will be recorded for easy viewing. In the case of medical error, the patient’s family will immediately be alerted, and recovery steps will be provided for them to understand.
